A website that lets you share content that will be visible only for a short time.

Users can follow others, getting a feed of content, where only one post is visible at once. They can swipe to either like it, or dislike it. This feed will be generated based on what the people they follow have shared and liked, and the system will learn their preferences, giving different weights to posts from different users to get them a relevant feed of posts.
